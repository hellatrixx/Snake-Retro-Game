# Snake-Retro-Game
This is a recreation of the popular snake game, created in processing.
This project was created as part of a Retro Game Developing competition that I was a part of.

To initiate the game, just open the file in processign and run the program. You can control the snake with the arrow buttons
and restart the game with the SHIFT button. You have three live and there is a score counter of the amount of apples eaten.
